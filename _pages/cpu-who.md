## CPU core

- [**Laurent Gatto**](http://lgatto.github.io/about/), head of the
  unit. He moved to Cambridge in January 2010 to work in the Cambridge
  Centre for Proteomics on various aspects of quantitative and spatial
  proteomics, developing methodological advances and implementing
  computational tools with a strong emphasis on rigorous and
  reproducible data analysis. He is also a visiting scientist in the
  [PRIDE team](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/) at the European
  Bioinformatics Institute, affiliate teaching staff at the
  [Cambridge Computational Biology Institute](http://www.ccbi.cam.ac.uk/),
  a [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/)
  fellow and a [Software](http://software-carpentry.org/) and
  [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) instructor.

- [**Lisa Breckels**](https://lmsimp.github.io/), Post-Doctoral
  Research Associate. Lisa joined the Cambridge Centre for Proteomics
  in November 2010 and CPU in August 2013. Her work focuses on the application 
  and development of machine learning and pattern recognition methods
  to enable robust analysis of high-throughput quantitative proteomics data.
  All her methods and algorithms form part of the
  [`pRoloc`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/pRoloc) framework for protein
  localisation prediction.

- [**Oliver Crook**](https://olivercrook.co.uk/) is a Wellcome Trust
  PhD student, jointly supervised with
  [Paul Kirk](http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/h-to-m/paul-kirk/) from
  MRC Biostatistics Unit and
  [Kathryn Lilley](http://www.bioc.cam.ac.uk/people/uto/lilley). Olly,
  works on new Bayesian methods for spatial proteomics, formalising
  the theoretical foundations and implementing the algorithms that
  will be included in [`pRoloc`](https://lgatto.github.io/pRoloc/).


## Undergraduates

- [**Robin Kohze**](https://github.com/Kohze) comes from the Radboud
  University Nijmegen and visits the group in the frame of his
  master's internship. He is developing a new infrastructure to
  facilitate the dissemination of spatial proteomics data.

## Remote members 

- [**Sebastian Gibb**](http://sebastiangibb.de/), Department of
  Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, University Medicine Greifswald,
  Germany. Sebastian visited the group 2014 and since then
  contributes to various projects, in particular
  [`MSnbase`](http://lgatto.github.io/MSnbase),
  [`Pbase`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/Pbase) and
  [`synapter`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/synapter), which he is
  currently leading the development of.

- [**Johannes Rainer**](http://www.eurac.edu/en/research/health/biomed/staff/Pages/staffdetails.aspx?persId=34084),
  Center for Biomedicine, EURAC, Bolzano, Italy is a contributor to
  the [`MSnbase`](http://lgatto.github.io/MSnbase) and
  [`Pbase`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/Pbase) packages.

## Key collaborators 

- [**Kathyn S. Lilley**](http://www.bioc.cam.ac.uk/people/uto/lilley),
  Cambridge Centre for Proteomics, Department of Biochemistry,
  University of Cambridge, UL. Kathryn's lab developed the
  state-of-the art LOPIT
  ([Dunkley *et al.* 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16618929))
  and hyperLOPIT
  ([Christoforou *et al.* 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26754106)) 
  technologies. Her lab is at the origin of some of the very best spatial proteomics
  datasets in the world, which we help to analyse and interpret by applying our
  dedicated software (see for example
  [Breckels *et al.* 2016 in F1000Research](https://f1000research.com/articles/5-2926/)).

- [**Sean Holden**](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sbh11/), Computer
  Laboratory. We collaborate with Sean on the development and
  application of machine learning algorithms to solve problems in
  spatial proteomics. A recent example is transfer learning
  ([Breckels *et al.* 2016](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004920)).

- [**Thomas Burger**](https://sites.google.com/site/thomasburgerswebpage/),
  BIG-BGE (Universit√© Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, CEA, INSERM), 38000
  Grenoble, France. We collaborate with Thomas and his group on
  various proteomics data analysis (for example missing data in
  [Lazar *et al* 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26906401))
  and software (see
  [Wieczorek *et al.* 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27605098)). Thomas
  contributed the *perTurbo* algorithms to
  [*pRoloc*](https://bioconductor.org/packages/pRoloc).

## Alumni 

- **Thomas Naake**, visited the group in Spring 2014 as an ERASMUS
  student affiliated to the University of Freiburg. He developed the
  first version of
  [`pRolocGUI`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/pRolocGUI.html),
  an interactive visualisation tools for organelle proteomics
  data. Thomas is now a PhD student at Max Planck Institute of
  Molecular Plant Physiology.

- **Vicky Butt**, Part III student in Systems Biology, applying
  graph-based methods to study protein sub-cellular
  localisation. Vicky is now pursuing a PhD at UCL.
