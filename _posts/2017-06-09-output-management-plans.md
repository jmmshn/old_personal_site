During the
[talk](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lgatto/2017_06_09_RDMF_London/blob/master/slides.html)
about early career researchers' view on modern and open scholarship I
presented at the
[Research Data Management Forum 2017](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/research-data-management-forum-rdmf/rdmf17)
in London, I described a short table comparing different aspects
related to data and software management.

As mentioned during the presentation, I see many commonalities between
data and software, and their management. In my grant applications, as
a computational scientist, I use the data management plan to document
the management of my software outputs
([here's](http://riojournal.com/articles.php?id=11624) an BBSRC DMP
that I published recently). The table reads

|Data            | Software       |
|--------------- |----------------|
|Static          | Dynamic        |
|Meta-data       | Documentation  |
|Large           | Small          |
|QC              | Testing        |
|DMP             | SMP            |
|DB, public repo | Version control in public repo|

As was clear from some discussions I had over coffee and lunch, most
of these points could be further discussed on their own, but I would
like to follow up on the bigger picture.


I stated that, for clarity, despite the many commonalities, it might
be useful to have dedicated data and software management plans, and
provide specific guidelines to reviewers and applicants. But, do we
really want to have a data management plan, a software management
plan, a material management plan, ... Probably not, as these outputs
are not independent anyway. Grant applicants would feel compelled to
fill out as many plans as possible, thus reinforcing the *box ticking*
feeling that is sometimes already associated with data management
plans. In an ideal situation, as discussed with
[Kevin Ashley](http://www.twitter.com/kevingashley) (thank you for
bringing this up), we would rather be looking at a unique, unified and
integrated output management plan, that documents all research
outputs, their management, their preservation and their dissemination
in a coordinated way.

Unfortunately, I feel that in the current climate, DMPs are not always
taken seriously enough, or may be those that write them (senior
researchers) do lack the skills and experience needed for effective
data and software management. May be there is still a need to make it
explicit that research has various different and valuable outputs,
beyond the mere advertisement that is eventually published in a
research journal, that these outputs are important, and that there is
a need for explicit guidance as to how to document their
management. I'm sure these alternatives must have been debated already
(this was touched upon, albeit briefly, at a recent BBSRC/SSI software
workshop I joined). I would be curious to hear what others think about
this.
