title: Bad publishing and bullied into bad science.

The recent long read about scientific publishing in the Guardian is
fantastic. It depicts a very telling story of
the
[research publishing landscape](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science).

<!--more-->

There is actually more to it, than *only* the predatory model of
publishing research and big deals. Big commercial publishers have
understood that this lucrative business model holds on them
*controlling* not only the research outputs, but the whole
process. Their current moves are to provide integrated platforms to
control and quantify researchers and research. The truly depressing
situation is that senior academics and university managers buy into
these initiatives, despite the catastrophic example of giving control
of (only) the papers.

The Guardian article begs for more questions - **What can we do? Who
can do anything, anyway?**

There are two stakeholders that, in my opinion, can improve on the
current situation: researchers themselves, and funders and **NOT**
publishers, who are part of the problem, not the solution (here are
some [slides](http://bit.ly/20170609rdmf) I presented at the 2017
Research Data Management Forum, where I talked about this topic)
Funders slowly push for greater openness in research, including open
access and preprints, but they don't push enough, in my opinion.

Unfortunately, researchers, in particular early career researcher, are
under a lot of pressure to *publish*, or (and) *perish*. Quoting Ross
Mounce

>  Doing valuable transparent reproducible science, and doing the best
>  to establish one's career in science appear to be almost mutually
>  exclusive things.

(I hope he's wrong!)

Here's another very relevant article on the topic

> [We can shift academic culture through publishing choices](https://f1000research.com/articles/6-518/v2)

that highlights choices researchers can make to stop exploiting
themselves and discriminating against others.

If you, as a early career researcher (ECRs), want to make a change,
help by participating in the *Bullied into bad science?* campaign, and
sign
the
[letter](https://cambridge.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6S9OXAydlFZz8cR),
that urges institutions and individuals to better support ECRs by
taking a set of actions:

1. Sign the [Declaration on Research Assessment](http://www.ascb.org/dora/)
   (DORA) as an independent university/institution/individual
2. Positively value a commitment to open research and publishing
   practices that keep profits inside academia when considering
   candidates for positions and promotions (in alignment with DORA).
3. Endorse immediate open publishing, favouring publications in
   journals that are 100% open access.
4. Endorse posting of preprints in recognised preprint servers to
   avoid publishing delays that are detrimental to ECR career
   progress.
5. Endorse, support and promote the open publication of data and other
   scientific outputs such as software.
6. Educate researchers about publishing practices via public
   statements, mandatory courses, and inductions that cover: open
   research/data/access, mandates, hidden costs of traditional
   publishing, and how to protect ECRs against exploitative publishing
   practices.
7. Increase transparency by reporting to the public how much
   institutions pay for research to be published to raise awareness
   about the significant drain on public funding.
8. Make all postdocs voting members of their institutions. ECRs are
   the future of research - give them a voice to promote their own
   future in the best possible way.

Support a better publishing landscape and a better, more open and
trustworthy research
by
[signing the letter](https://cambridge.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6S9OXAydlFZz8cR) and
supporting this initiative.

**Update**: Here's an
article,
[Academics strike back against bad science](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/academics-strike-back-against-bad-science-t5mzcdxv8),
published in *The Times* about our campaign.
