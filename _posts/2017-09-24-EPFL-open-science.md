This post constitutes my talk at
the [OPEN SCIENCE IN PRACTICE 2017](https://osip2017.epfl.ch/) summer
school in Lausanne, on the 25 September 2017. The slides used during
the presentation are available [here](http://bit.ly/20170925OpenScienceEPFL).

Here's a
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUoKV38HtcU) of a
shorter version of this talk, presented in the evening at the EPFL
library.

**Abstract:** If *research is the by-product of researchers getting
promoted* (a quote by
[David Barron, Professor of Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_W._Barron),
Prof. Leslie Carr, personal communication), then shouldn't we, early
career researchers (ECRs), focus on promotion and being docile
academic citizens rather than aiming for the more noble cause of
pursuing research to understand the world that surrounds us, and
disseminate our findings using modern channels?
Indeed,
[I have already argued](https://lgatto.github.io/open-research-project/) that
a critical point that is failing us, is the academic promotion of open
research and open researcher, as a way to promote a more rigorous and
sound research process and tackle the reproducibility crisis. In this
talk, I will present the case for open scholarship from an early
career researcher's perspective, pointing out that being an open
researcher is not only the *right* thing to do, but is also the *best*
thing to do.


## Introduction

I am going to refer to the protagonists of this talk as *we*, we
all. While I will focus specifically on early career researchers [^1]
(ECRs), I really want to be inclusive, and use 'we'. The reason is
that open research is not only a concern for ECRs - that's only the
main theme of my talk - is concerns us all. In particular, we, ECRs,
need *more* support from senior/established academics, librarians,
funders, ... Together, each of us in own quality, we need to drive
change for a better, more open research environment.

[^1]: ECR can broadly be define as a post-graduate student, a researcher in academia or industry or at a non-governmental organisation who is unemployed or on a temporary contract, or within 10 years of obtaining a permanent post. It doesn't primarily relate to the age of the person.


It is also important to highlight that **open is not a replacement of
good research**. I have heard too often that open access is synonym of
lesser publication. This is clearly nonsense, and the result of
ignorance or the sole desire to harm those that publish on open access
venues. We need to work hard to do the best research, and share it
openly. As I will argue later, I would even claim that **open is a
gateway to better research**. So let's not give anyone an opportunity
to be confused.

I also tend to refer to *open research* rather than *open science* as
to not explicitly exclude non-STEM field. And while my views will
however resonate with scientists primarily, I believe many of the
discussions below should also apply to other communities.

### Who?

A few words about myself to offer some context on my view on modern
and open scholarship:

I am [Laurent Gatto](https://lgatto.github.io/), an **early career
researcher** at the University of Cambridge, UK. I am a Senior
Research Associate (**non-established research staff**) in the
department of Biochemistry and a
[principal investigator in the Cambridge Systems Biology Centre](https://www.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/Investigators/laurent-gatto).

My research focuses on the **reproducible** analysis and interpretation
of high-throughput biological **data** and the development of
statistical machine learning methods and **research software**.

I am a **open scholar** and make a point of being vocal about it.

## What is Open Research/Science

Any research output should be

- Free to read/access: no barriers to access knowledge
- Free to re-use (data, software, text and data mining, ...)

But also

- Free to publish (or how the golden OA movement excludes the global
  south and benefits commercial/hybrid predatory publishers[^2]. See
  also the
  [pay-to-publish model](http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/70/4/403)).
  
[^2]: Predators aren't the poor quality journals that disseminate spam, these are *opportunistic* publishers. The real predators are the big traditional and commercial that have taken control of scholarly dissemination and do everything they can to maintain it and maximise their gains. See for example [Why Software and data papers are a bad solution to a real problem](https://lgatto.github.io/software-data-papers/).

Open research/science should also be

- Inclusive 

More on this below.

## Open vs. closed?

Let's first reflect on the nature of science, and whether there really
should be anything like *explicitly* open science.

In 1942, Robert Merton introduced his four
[Mertonian norms of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mertonian_norms) (pdf:
[The Sociology of Science](http://www.collier.sts.vt.edu/5424/pdfs/merton_1973.pdf), a set of institutional imperatives taken to represent the
ethos of modern science.

- **universalism**: scientific validity is independent of the 
  sociopolitical status/personal attributes of its participants
- **communalism**: all scientists should have common ownership of
  scientific goods (intellectual property), to promote collective
  collaboration; secrecy is the opposite of this norm.
- **disinterestedness**: scientific institutions act for the benefit of
  a common scientific enterprise, rather than for the personal gain of
  individuals within them
- **organised scepticism**: scientific claims should be exposed to
  critical scrutiny before being accepted: both in methodology and
  institutional codes of conduct.

Are these imperatives in line with current practice? Status of
researchers and their institutions has major influence on their
incomes and outputs, and ownership, IP and secrecy are part of research
business at the highest level. Personal gain is not unheard of in
science (see
[Danny Kingsley's recent key note talks at COASP9](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/267263) for
examples of financial rewards for publishing in certain
venues). Finally, scepticism is organised and controlled by an elite
and validated by commercial publishers. On the other hand, the
imperatives are line with principles promoted by open science.

More recently, in 2015, Mick Watson asked the question more
directly:
[When will *open science* become simply *science*?](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-015-0669-2).

![When will ‘open science’ become simply ‘science’?](/images/doi-13059-015-0669-2.png) 

I claim that **open is a gateway to more trustworthy research**. 

- Open research is research that enables reproducible and repeatable
  research.
- Open research is transparent and honest research.
- Open research is research that we can build upon.

Open is better, and we should always aim for the better, not the
worse.

But then,

> Why would anyone not want to do open research?

Note that nobody ever claimed (as far as I know, anyway) to do *closed
science*. And there's no black-and-white situation between open and
non-open/closed. There is always a degree of how far one wants, or
can, promote the most open possible research.

## Why isn't it open?

Incentives in for open career progression aren't there (yet? - see
below). On the contrary...

> If *research is the by-product of researchers getting promoted* (a
> quote by
> [David Barron, Professor of Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_W._Barron),
> Prof. Leslie Carr, personal communication), then shouldn't we, early
> career researchers (ECRs), focus on promotion and being docile
> academic citizens rather than aiming for the more noble cause of

> disseminate our findings using modern channels?

In my opinion, barriers are not technological, but rather
socio-cultural and political.

- Systemic control and inertia
- Vested interests by people in charge 
- Abuse of power dynamics
- Fear of being scooped (**update** - an editorial in PLoS Biology on
  [*The importance of being second*](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005203) and,
  and how they prefer to focus on *complementary research*,
  recognising its important role in reproducibility of science.)
- Fear of not being credited
- Fear of errors and public humiliation, risk for reputation
- Fear of information overload
- ...
- Fear of becoming less competitive in a over-competitive market!

While it is important to identify why open can look dangerous to some,
I don't want to spent too much time discussing these points. See Jon
Tennant's recent presentation about
[*Barriers to Open Science for junior researchers*](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5383711.v1.)  on
figshare for more details.

The important message at this point is that, many if not all of these
fears are only *perceived* risks. Let's move on to why ECRs should
seriously consider being open researchers.

## Go OPEN! 

Open science/research is particularly important for ECRs. Open
research practices are here, and won't go away. It is clear that they
will increase in the near future. If *you*, as an ECR, want to be a
competitive researcher in the coming years (and you'll need to be),
you'll need to be well versed in open research practices. 

Here, I give some reasons and examples supporting my claims.

### Funders' requirements

- CC-BY open access publication (golden or green) with limited embargo
  period. In the UK, Wellcome Trust and all RCUK funders.
- Requirement for a data management plan
  (see [here](https://riojournal.com/articles.php?id=11624) for one of
  mine)
- Open data mandatory for H2020 grants and many national applications.
- The Wellcome Trust recently
  [expanded it's data management plan](https://wellcome.ac.uk/news/our-new-policy-sharing-research-data-what-it-means-you) to
  any research outputs (software, antibodies, cell lines, ...) (July 2017).

### Acceptance of open practice: pre-prints

- [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.ac.uk/news/we-now-accept-preprints-grant-applications) (Jan 2017) and the [Medical Research Council (MRC)](https://www.mrc.ac.uk/research/policies-and-guidance-for-researchers/preprints/) (April 2017) accept pre-prints in grant applications.
- NIH [encourages submission of pre-prints](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-17-050.html) and cite them (March 2017).

### Open science evaluation criteria

The EU's
[Evaluation of Research Careers fully acknowledging Open Science Practice](https://cdn1.euraxess.org/sites/default/files/policy_library/os-rewards-wgreport-final_integrated_0.pdf) defines an Open Science Career Assessment Matrix (OS-CAM):

![Open Science Career Assessment Matrix (OS-CAM)](/images/2017-09-21-eu-os-cam.png)

[Reproducibility and open science are starting to matter in tenure and promotion](https://cos.io/blog/are-reproducibility-and-open-science-starting-matter-tenure-and-promotion-review/) July
14th, 2017, Brian Nosek

> In any case, my experience with **promotion review requests** this
> summer suggests that change is occurring, particularly in assigning
> **scholarly value to open science** contributions and behavior, and it’s
> great to see.

### Open as a career boost

The majority concluded that there is a **significant citation
advantage for Open Access articles**.

![Citation advantage](https://f1000researchdata.s3.amazonaws.com/manuscripts/10376/4f98c19e-717b-4d16-87c5-aaf0602e1ff8_figure2.gif)

**Open access articles get more citations** The relative citation rate
(OA: non-OA) in 19 fields of research. This rate is defined as the
mean citation rate of OA articles divided by the mean citation rate of
non-OA articles.

See also [**Why Open Research**](http://whyopenresearch.org/).

### Reproducible research

Who hasn't hear of the reproducibility crisis? A major underlying
factor of the lack of reproducibility is the lack of openness
(voluntary or accidental):

- Is the data available and re-usable?
- Is the software available usable?
- Is the method described in enough details?
- ...

(More about reproducible research below)

Institutions should worry about research being reproducible and
trustworthy, and some argue for it.

[![Faculty promotion must assess reproducibility](/images/2017-09-22-promotion-rr.png)](https://www.nature.com/news/faculty-promotion-must-assess-reproducibility-1.22596)

### We still need more

But, let's face it, in practice, it is currently still relatively easy
to brush over many of these requirements. In addition, the incentives
are still inconsequential compared to the (perceived) risks. Maybe we
need more threads when not being open.

## What can we do?

### Build openness at the core your research

Many aspects of open research, and arguable the most important ones,
can't be implemented as an afterthought. You won't be able to share
data that you don't have anymore, or can't find. You won't want to
share poor data or ugly code (half-backed, un-annotated, without any
documentation), because you'll look like a fool. You won't be able to
reproduce any results if your don't make your research repeatable.

In that respect, I want to briefly talk about the *SpatialMap*
project, which aims at producing a visualisation and data sharing
platform for
[spatial proteomics](https://lgatto.github.io/cpu-spat-prot-2015/). I
decided to promote and drive it as openly as possible in the frame of the
[Open Research Pilot Project](http://osc.cam.ac.uk/open-research/open-research-pilot-project). The ORPP is a joint project by
the [Office of Scholarly Communication](http://osc.cam.ac.uk/) at the
University of Cambridge and the
[Wellcome Trust Open research team](https://wellcome.ac.uk/what-we-do/our-work/open-research). From
the official page, the pilot project looks at:

- the support research groups' need in order to make all aspects of
  their research open,
- why they want to do this,
- how it benefits them,
- how it improves the research process
- what barriers there might be that prevent the sharing of their
  research.

Four research groups from Cambridge have been selected to
participate. The project proceeds through meetings with all
participants (every 6 months), discussions between the research groups
and their recognised OSC collaborator, blog posts and occasional
emails on a dedicate mailing
list. ([Here](https://lgatto.github.io/open-research-project/) are
some early thoughts about the project itself.)

Here are the reasons why the *SpatialMap* project is an open project:

1. The *SpatialMap* project in itself is about opening up spatial
   proteomics data by facilitating data sharing and providing tools to
   further the comprehension of the data. One aim is to allow users to
   use the *SpatialMap* web portal to upload, share, explore and
   discuss their data privately with collaborators in a first instance
   (few researchers share their data before publication), then make
   the data available to reviewer, and finally, once reviewed, make it
   public at the push of a button. The incentive for early utilisation
   of the platform is to provide interactive data visualisation and
   integration with other tools and sharing of the data with close
   collaborators.

2. The project is developed completely openly in a public
   [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SpatialMap/SpatialMapDev)[^3]. Absolutely
   all code and contributions are publicly available. Anyone can
   collaborate, or even *fork* the project and build their own.

3. I publicly announced the *SpatialMap* project in
   a [blog post](https://lgatto.github.io/spatialmap-proposal/). The
   blog post was written as a legitimate grant application (albeit a
   little bit shorter and sticking to the most important parts).

[^3]: Github is an online interface to the `git` version control software, which allows to track changes in any text file, revert back to any version. On top of a web interface to the version controlling, Github allows to file at track issues, and tremendously facilitate collaborative online development. I use it for pretty all my research and coding projects, papers, collaboration, analysis reports, ...

Note that I do not have any dedicated funding for this project. The
progress so far was the result of a masters student visiting my
group. Given that the project is not trivial, I am considering
applying for dedicated funding to support the project.

### Promoting open research through peer review

This section is based on my
[The role of peer-reviewers in ~~checking supporting information~~ promoting open science](https://rawgit.com/lgatto/2017-03-30-OSC-peerreview/master/slides.html) talk.

As an open researcher, I think it is important to apply and promote
the importance of data and good data management on a day-to-day basis
(see for example Marta Teperek's 2017
[Data Management: Why would I bother?](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.897785) slides),
but also to express this ethic in our academic capacity, such as peer
review. My responsibility as a reviewer is to

* Accept sound/valid research and provide constructive comments

and hence

* Focus firstly on the validity of the research by inspecting the
  data, software and method. If the methods and/or data fail, the rest
  is meaningless.

I don't see novelty, relevance, news-worthiness as my business as a
reviewer. These factors are not the prime qualities of thorough
research, but rather characteristics of flashy news.

Here are some aspects that are easy enough to check, and go a long way
to verify the availability and validity and of the data

1. **Availability**: Are the data/software/methods accessible and
   understandable in a way that would allow an informed researcher in
   the same or close field to reproduce and/or verify the results
   underlying the claims? Note that this doesn't mean that as a
   reviewer, I will necessarily try to repeat the whole analysis (that
   would be too time consuming indeed). But, conversely, a submission
   without data/software will be reviewed (and rejected, or more
   appropriately send back for completion) in matters of minutes. Are
   the data available in a public repository that guarantees that it
   will remain accessible, such as a subject-specific or, if none is
   available, a generic repository (such
   as [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)
   or [figshare](https://figshare.com/), ...), an institutional
   repository (we have [Apollo](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/) at
   the University of Cambridge), or, but less desirable, supplementary
   information or a personal webpage[^4].

2. **Meta-data**: It's of course not enough to provide a wild dump of
   the data/software/..., but these need to be appropriately
   documented. Personally, I recommend an `README` file in every top
   project directory to summarise the project, the data, ...

3. **Do numbers match?**: The first thing when reproducing someone's
   analysis is to match the data files to the experimental
   design. That is one of the first things I check when reviewing a
   paper. For example if the experimental design says there are 2
   groups, each with 3 replicates, I expect to find 6 (or a multiple
   thereof) data files or data columns in the data matrix. Along these
   lines, I also look at the file names (of column names in the data
   matrix) for a consistent naming convention, that allows to match
   the files (columns) to the experimental groups and replicates.
  
4. **What data, what format**: Is the data readable with standard and
   open/free software? Are the raw and processed available, and have
   the authors described how to get from one to the other? 

5. **License**: Is the data shared in a way that allows users to
   re-use it. Under what conditions? Is the research output shared
   under a valid license?

[^4]: There is often no perfect solution, and a combination of the above might be desirable.

Make sure that the data adhere to the
**[FAIR](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) principles**:

>  Findable and Accessible and Interoperable and Reusable

Note that SI are not FAIR, not discoverable, not structured,
voluntary, used to bury stuff. A personal web page is likely to
disappear in the near future.

As a quick note, my *ideal* review system would be one where

1. Submit your data to a repository, where it get’s checked (by
   specialists, data scientists, data curators) for quality,
   annotation, meta-data.

2. Submit your research with a link to the peer reviewed data. First
   review the intro and methods, then only the results (to avoid
   positive results bias).

When talking about open research and peer review, one logical
extension is **open peer review**. While I personally value open peer
review and practice it when possible, it can be a difficult issue for
ECRs, exposing them unnecessarily when reviewing work from prominent
peers. It also can reinforce an already unwelcoming environment for
underrepresented minorities. See more about this in the *Inclusivity:
open science and open science* section below.

### Be reproducible!

[![Five selfish reasons to work reproducibly](/images/2017-09-22-selfish-rr.png)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0850-7)

> And so, my fellow scientists: ask not what you can do for
> reproducibility; ask what reproducibility can do for you!

Florian Markowetz.. Five selfish reasons to work reproducibly, Genome
Biology 2015 16:274 https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0850-7

1. **Reproducibility helps to avoid disaster**: a project is more than
   a beautiful result. You need to record in detail how you got
   there. Starting to work reproducibly early on will save you time
   later. I had cases where a collaborator told me they preferred the
   results on the very first plots they received, that I couldn't
   recover a couple of month later. But because my work was
   reproducible and I had tracked it over time (using git and GitHub),
   I was able, after a little bit of data analysis forensics, to
   identify why these first, preliminary plots weren't consistent with
   later results (and it as a simple, but very relevant bug in the
   code). Imagine if my collaborators had just used these first plots
   for publication, or to decide to perform further experiments.
   
2. **Reproducibility makes it easier to write papers**: Transparency
   in your analysis makes writing papers much easier. In dynamic
   documents (using
   [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/),
   [juypter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and other similar tools),
   all results are automatically update when the data are changed. You
   can be confident your numbers, figures and tables are up-to-date.
   
3. **Reproducibility helps reviewers see it your way**: a reproducible
   document will tick many of the boxes enumerated above. You will
   make me very happy reviewer if I can review a paper that is
   reproducible.
4. **Reproducibility enables continuity of your work:** quoting
   Florian, "In my own group, I don't even discuss results with
   students if they are not documented well. No proof of
   reproducibility, no result!".
5. **Reproducibility helps to build your reputation:** publishing
   reproducible research will build you the reputation of being an
   honest and careful researcher. In addition, should there ever be a
   problem with a paper, a reproducible analysis will allow to track
   the error and show that you reported everything in good faith.

### Promoting open research/science

If you want, as an ECR, you can also promote open
research/science. Most of the open science supporters are young
researchers that want to improve a system they find unhealthy, unfair
and does not support good scientific practice. 

[![No researcher is too junior to fix science](/images/2017-09-21-fix-science.png)](https://www.nature.com/news/no-researcher-is-too-junior-to-fix-science-1.21928)

Promoting open science, especially when done in an constructive way,
might also give you an online presence that can be helpful in
raising you profile as a researcher.

Open science practice is also a valuable and transferable skill. Good
data management and reproducible research might not always be skills
that are appreciated in academia, but in many other fields (for
example anything related to data science), they are absolutely
essential. Science policy is also a very desirable career choice for
many STEM graduates, and with the growing importance of open science,
these skills would be an important addition to your CV.

You can also support and join open science initiatives. One example
I'll be talking more about is
the [BulliedIntoBadScience](http://bulliedintobadscience.org/)
campaign, an initiative by ECRs for ECRs who aim for a fairer, more
open and ethical research and publication environment.

## What can institutions and senior academics do?

One of the most depressing observations when promoting open research
is the lack of support by senior academics, whether they have vested
interests, are *only* mis-informed about open science, or just have no
incentive to drive any change. Fortunately, it's also important to
highlight that there are established academics who support open
research, but they are a minority.

Here are eight actions that researchers and institutions should follow
to improve open research and open ECR:

1. Sign the Declaration on Research Assessment
   ([DORA](http://www.ascb.org/dora/)), make hiring and promotion
   criteria explicit and highlight that the content and quality of
   research outputs are more important than the venue they are
   published in.
2. Positively value the commitment to open research and publishing
   practices when considering candidates for positions and promotions.
3. Endorse immediate open publishing, favouring publications in
   journals that are 100% open access.
4. Endorse posting of pre-prints in recognised pre-print servers to
   avoid publishing delays that are detrimental to career progress for
   ECRs.
5. Endorse, support and promote the open publication of data and other
   scientific outputs such as software.
6. Educate researchers about publishing practices via public
   statements, mandatory courses, and inductions that cover open
   research/data/access, mandates, the hidden costs of traditional
   publishing and how to protect ECRs from exploitative publishing
   practices.
7. Report to the public how much institutions pay for research to be
   published, to raise awareness about the significant drain on public
   funding.
8. Make all postdocs and ECRs full voting members of their
   institutions to increase diversity and stay connected to the
   changing needs of this underrepresented group.

These points are taken from
the [BulliedIntoBadScience](http://bulliedintobadscience.org/)
campaign, an initiative by ECRs for ECRs who aim for a fairer, more
open and ethical research and publication environment.

> our campaign!

Funders have a paramount role to play in the promotion of open
research. Many, especially the Wellcome Trust in the UK, have
established mandates and requirement to promote some aspects of open
research, such as open access publication of all the research they
fund (see above). There is however much more they can do to actively
promote open researcher in general, and open ECR in particular.

## Inclusivity: open science and open science

There is 

> Open Science as in widely disseminated and openly accessible

and

> Open Science as in inclusive and welcoming

As far as I was concerned for a long time (until June 2017 to be
accurate - this section is based
this
[Open science and open science](https://lgatto.github.io/open-and-open/) post),
the former more technical definition was always what I was focusing
on, and the second community-level aspect of openness was, somehow,
implicit from the former, but that's not the case. 

Even if there are efforts to promote diversity, under-represented
minorities (URM) don't necessarily feel
[included](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6356/1101.full).
When it comes to open science/research URMs can be further
discriminated against by greater exposure or, can't always afford to
be vocal.

- Not everybody has the privilege to be open.
- There are different levels in how open one wants, or how open one
  could afford to be.
- Every voice and support is welcome.

## Conclusions

> It's all about research quality and integrity!

Make sure you are ready to be open (for yourself now, your future
self, open the your group/institute, or open to the research community
or to the public)

- manage and annotate you data
- backup everything up
- open source development 
- online presence
- ...

and be as open and promote openness as much as you can.

> There's more than one open.

Better research also means more diverse and inclusive research and a
inclusive research environment. And, there are many useful ways and
levels to be open.


> You want to do more. Yes please!

Inertia is very strong in academia. There are many stakeholders
involved, and too few that really want to drive change, due to vested
interests and the comfort of their position. There are too many
battles to fight, so pick yours wisely, otherwise you seriously risk
to be exhausted and completely demoralised.

There's room for innovation and exploration, as well as influencing and
advising the current establishment (slower, but as important).


It is not easy to predict where Open Research/Science will get in the
future. Open access has had both positive (widening access) and
negative effects (when being re-purposed for commercial benefits, see
also a recent interview with Leslie Chan,
[Confessions of an Open Access Advocat](https://ocsdnet.org/confessions-of-an-open-access-advocate-leslie-chan/)).
As ECRs, we are the future of research and the future of research
dissemination. We mustn't be afraid of experimenting, debating, and
challenging the establishment.
