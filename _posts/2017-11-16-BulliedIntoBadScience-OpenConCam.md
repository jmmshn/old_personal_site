This is the content of my talk at
[OpenConCam](http://www.opencon2017.org/lgatt0/opencon_2017_cambridge),
the OpenCon satellite meeting in Cambridge, presented on the 16
November 2017. The slides are available

## Together on a journey

I am going to tell you about a long, still on-going journey. I'll
talk about my journey, but it applies to other, I know that. And when
you are on a long journey, you meet many people, and some help and
support on your journey. Before telling more about this journey, I
would like to thank some people that are close to my heart when it
comes to open science and open research. These are the people
who [helped organising this meeting](http://www.openconcam.org/), and
its predecessors; these are people who share the values I will be
talking about; and there's in particular the ever
inspiring [Corina Logan](http://corinalogan.com/), who is the person
who initiated
the [#BulliedIntoBadScience](http://bulliedintobadscience.org/)
campaign.

## Yes, it's personal!

I do care a lot about my work as a researcher, very much indeed. I am
a scientist doing research in the area of computational biology, more
specifically
in
[spatial proteomics](https://lgatto.github.io/cpu-spat-prot-2015/). At
the end of my degree (that was in biology), I was unable to imagine
anything else I could do other than research. I never intended to do
the kind of research I am doing now, but I wanted to understand the
world around me by doing research. What has fascinated me since that
time is the method of scientific investigation, a method to observe,
define hypotheses, test them, and validate or invalidate them.  That's
how we can understand the world that surrounds us.

What are some of the features that make this scientific investigation
such a universally powerful paradigm? The science that I am passionate
about is characterised by:

- **Trust** - I need to trust you to stand on your shoulders.
- **Reproducibility** - it's not only your shoulders I will stand on.
- **Openness** - I need to know what I am going to stand on. And I want
  **everybody** to be able to know.

I didn't realise this as a young PhD student, when initiating my
journey. Nobody actually ever taught me that these concepts are among
the very foundations that make science what it is, i.e. that we can
stand on the shoulders of the giants that preceded us, and that,
maybe, others will be able to stand on my shoulders, one day. This is
the kind of science that I am passionate about, that I feel I can
continue doing until the very end.

## So what is this talk about?

It is about the science that **we** are passionate about, it's about
the science that we can trust.

But that is not always the science that is practised. 

This is a quote shared with us by one of the ECR signatories of the
**#BulliedIntoBadScience** campaign.

> I have been constantly harassed by superiors to modify data in order
> to provide better agreement with known experimental values in order
> to make the paper look better for publishing in prestigious
> journals.

We all have constraints in our work, in our lives. We don't live and
work in an ivory tower. Things can be hard at time. Things are
certainly harder for many than there are for me. We have to live with
these constraints, and we have to do our research with these in mind.

But there are some compromises that we won't make. We want to pursue
our research following our values, following the principles that
prompted us and guided us along the way.

## The campaign

> The [Bullied Into Bad Science](http://BulliedIntoBadScience.org/)
> campaign is an initiative by early career researchers (ECRs) for
> early career researchers who aim for a fairer, more open and ethical
> research and publication environment.

Because science and academia are not necessarily aligned. Because a
good researcher and a successful researcher are not the same
thing. With this campaign, we want to lead individuals and
institutions in adopting open practices to improve research rigour. We
want a good researcher and a successful academic to realign.

## Some background

The **#BulliedIntoBadScience** campaign didn't come out of the blue,
but is the result of efforts that didn't lead to satisfactory
outcomes. Efforts that often lead to disappointment and frustrations.

We have already written about the background behind the campaign, such
as for example in this PLoS ECR
[post](http://blogs.plos.org/thestudentblog/2017/09/01/bullied-into-going-national-early-career-researchers-are-taking-initiative/). Here,
I want to provide a short summary to give you an idea of why this
campaign exists.

## Success?

It is difficult to say whether the campaign has been successful so
far. Success is relative anyway. But here are a couple of points that
we could consider indicators of success, or lack thereof.


- [Corina](http://corinalogan.com/) just won a Shuttleworth Foundation
  Flash Grant for **#BulliedIntoBadScience**! **WIN**

- Numbers: There are at this moment **140 ECRs** that have signed the
  campaign and **73 non-ECRs** (senior academics, people outside
  academia) that officially support it - unsure what they really
  mean.

- Feedback: we only got postive and supportive feedback so far -
  **WIN**

- In Cambridge, there hasn't been any change as a result of the
  campaign - **FAIL**. (But that doesn't matter, as long as others
  benefit. It never was meant to be a Cambridge thing anyway) ...
  
- ... as for Cambridge signing the Declaration on Research Assessment
  (DORA): "No way on Godâ€™s earth" - **FAIL**

## Continuing the fight

- Approach prominent academics directly, because we need to show that
  those in charge also care, so that ECRs don't feel intimidated to
  raise their voice. 

- We have submitted evidence to the UK Parliament Science and
  Technology Committee inquiry on
  [Research Integrity](https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/inquiries/parliament-2017/research-integrity-17-19/) in the name of the campaign.
  
- An update to our web page is immindent, including translations (we
  are looking for more translators!), and we want to write regular
  blog posts.

- We want to discuss the signature of DORA at the
  [Regent House](https://www.governance.cam.ac.uk/governance/key-bodies/RH-Senate/Pages/default.aspx) at
  the University of Cambridge?

## Everyday struggle

- And what about my **day job**? Why do *ECRs* need to fight for
  **better**, **open** and more **trustworthy** research?
  
- What's the impact of being an open activist on my academic
  **career**?  **Good, IMHO!**
  (see [here](https://lgatto.github.io/EPFL-open-science/) for more
  details)
  
- There is so much work, and so little time. There are too many fights
  to pick - **pick the battles that matter most to you**.

- There are multiple ways to fight any battle, and often several are
  needed in parallel: **official** procedure and **community** efforts.

## It's not only personal

I started this presentation by sharing my experience, and highlighting
how the current unethical research environment affected me. But it's
not about me, of course. It would be too easy for those, who don't
have ethical research high on their agenda, to dismiss everything in a
blink of an eye.

There is of course a community of ECR - PhD students, postdocs,
tenure-tracked researchers, ... - on whose shoulders I stand at this
very moment. These are those who do the research, the all too often
silent working force that drive research every single day. These are
the researchers who have signed or support this campaign. And there
are many more that haven't yet.

## Final word

If there's one thing that is important to remember, it's that

> No researcher is too junior to fix science!

(find the reference [here](https://www.nature.com/news/no-researcher-is-too-junior-to-fix-science-1.21928))

But while no researcher is too young, some certainly are more
vulnerable than others. It is thus even more important that the more
privileged ones (and that certainly counts me: white, male, from a
prestigious institution) make themselves heard so that, together
