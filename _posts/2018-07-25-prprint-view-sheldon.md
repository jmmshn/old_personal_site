In this [News &
Comments](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05789-4)
published in Nature on the 24 July, Tom Sheldon claims that *Preprints
could promote confusion and distortion* and the public dissemination
of research outputs before peer review represents a risk of
mis-information by journalists.

The article has gathered quite a bit of pretty [negative
feedback](https://twitter.com/lteytelman/status/1021814235599269888)
by researchers on twitter. I haven't seen any positive feedback, but
that's most likely due to those that I follow.

Interestingly, Tom Sheldon send an email enquiring about that very
same issue on the 12 July.

All researchers that were asked agreed that peer review wasn't a
guarantee to quality or truth and that pre-prints were a positive
contribution.

Here's my answer to his enquiry.

> Dear Tom,
>
> Here are my thoughts.
>
> First of all, I am not convinced that a peer reviewed paper is
> necessarily better than a non reviewed pre-print. By better, I
> really mean scientifically rigorous.
>
> What you describe in your hypothetical, yet plausible example, is
> the pressure and/or lack of rigour that would bring some journalists
> to cut corners to get a sexy story out before the competition. These
> are the very same reasons that lead editors to publish big claims in
> glamour journals without proper scrutiny, or researchers to pursue
> and publish their big paper at all costs.
>
> In my opinion, if there's indeed a demand and offer for dubious hot
> scientific news, there will be other means to release and abuse
> them. I am not sure that pre-prints are the problem - let's not
> throw the baby out with the water.
>
> Hope this helps.

> Best whishes,
